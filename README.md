UI mistakes: I think the main mistakes are the different space between TextViews and between dividing lines. I have solved those 
mistakes. Also it would be nice if the pictures are loaded only when they needed. For example, by pressing a button or some other 
control. Because if user wants to see only status of application, there is no need to waste traffic to download photos. And, on my 
mind, it would be better if the status was on the right side.
